# New-York-City-Taxi-Trip-Duration

The goal of this project is to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City using machine learning models. The primary dataset used is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables. The dataset contains more than 510,000 rows and has been used in a Kaggle competition

The project involves building machine learning models to predict the trip duration of a taxi ride based on certain inputs. The models used in the project include linear regression, decision tree regression, lasso, ridge, and elastic net.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data)

# Model Performance
The performance of each model is as follows:
**Linear Regression:**
* Accuracy: 98.75%
  
**Lasso:**
* Mean Squared Error: 0.639
  
**Ridge:**
* Mean Squared Error: 0.6087
  
**Decision Tree Regression:**
* Mean Squared Error: 0.3660

**Elastic Net:**
* Root Mean Squared Error: 0.797

# Result

Based on the performance metrics, the best model for this project is the decision tree regression model, as it has the lowest mean squared error among all the models used
